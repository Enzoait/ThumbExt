![ThumbExt Preview Image](/img/thumbext_preview.png)

ThumbExt. is a free simple open source YouTube video's thumbnail extractor that helps you to quicly and easily get and download a thumbnail from any YouTube video you want, by using the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3?hl=en).

## Installation

### 1) Download

Fork this repository or download the .zip code and extract it somewhere easily accesible on your computer.

### 2) Open the tool

ThumbExt is set to be deployed as a website with it's own host name in the future, but for now, you can still access it offline. 

To do so, just open **homepage.html** with your internet browser.

### 3) Enter your API Key

As ThumbExt. uses the YouTube API, you will need a YouTube Data v3's API key that you can generate by visiting [The Google Cloud Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=muzzer).

Once you generated your key, simply open the **script.js** file, copy your generated API key and paste it in the ***API_KEY*** variable :

```js
var API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" // You can generate your own API key by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
```
